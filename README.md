# About
The aim of this project is to develop a UI to display, record, configure, and notify of real-time feedback on a subject carrying out a lifting task. As such, it could be utilised as a preventative measure for lumbosacral injury and act as an enabler for ease of further research. If successful, similar techniques could also be deployed on a wider scale to assist in physiotherapy or manual lifting jobs.
