# Lumbar Insight

## About

The aim of this project is to develop a UI to display, record, configure, and notify of real-time feedback on a subject carrying out a lifting task. As such, it could be utilised as a preventative measure for lumbosacral injury and act as an enabler for ease of further research. If successful, similar techniques could also be deployed on a wider scale to assist in physiotherapy or manual lifting jobs.

## Supported IMU Devices

- Shimmer 3
- Shimmer 2/2r

Support for further IMUs can be added by implementing IMUInterface.m and modifying connectDevice() in Model.m.
